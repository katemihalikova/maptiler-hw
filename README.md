# maptiler-hw

Recruitment task repository for [MapTiler SDK](https://docs.maptiler.com/sdk-js/)

## Install dependencies

After cloning the repository, install all required dependencies using:

```sh
npm install
```

## Start development

Start the Vite local development server with HMR (hot module replacement) using:

```sh
npm run dev
```

When you do any changes to the source code, the application automatically rebuilds and reloads.

## Build production version

When the app is ready for deployment, create a production build using:

```sh
npm run build
```

This creates a `dist` folder with all the files required to run the app. Upload all files to a webserver of your choice.

To immediately check if the production version runs fine without uploading it first, use:

```sh
npm run preview
```

Please note that this command just runs a webserver, it does not build the production version automatically, you need to run both commands to build and preview the latest version of the source code.
